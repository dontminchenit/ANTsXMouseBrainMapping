## The ANTsX Ecosystem for mouse brain mapping 

As noted previously, many of the existing packages designed for processing mouse
brain image data use ANTsX tools for core processing steps in various workflows,
particularly its pairwise, intensity-based image registration capabilities and
bias field correction. Historically, ANTsX development is originally based on
fundamental approaches to image mapping
[@Bajcsy:1982aa;@Bajcsy:1989aa;@Gee:2003aa], particularly in the human brain,
which has resulted in core contributions to the field such as the well-known and
highly-vetted Symmetric Normalization (SyN) algorithm [@Avants:2008aa].  Since
its development, various independent platforms have been used to evaluate ANTsX
image registration capabilities in the context of different application foci
which include multi-site brain MRI data [@Klein:2009aa], pulmonary CT data
[@Murphy:2011aa], and most recently, multi-modal brain registration in the
presence of tumors [@Baheti:2021aa].

Apart from its registration capabilities, ANTsX comprises additional
functionality such as template generation [@Avants:2010aa], point set data
approximation [@Tustison:2006aa], and deep learning networks specifically
trained for mouse data (see Table \ref{table:methods}). The comprehensive use of
the toolkit has demonstrated superb performance in multiple application areas
(e.g., consensus labeling [@Wang:2013ab], brain tumor segmentation
[@Tustison:2014aa], and cardiac motion estimation [@Tustison:2015ab] ).
Importantly, ANTs is built on the Insight Toolkit (ITK) [@McCormick:2014aa]
deriving benefit from the open-source community of scientists and programmers
and providing an open-source venue for algorithmic development, evaluation, and
improvement.

## ANTsX-based open-source contributions

Consistent with previous ANTsX development, the newly introduced capabilities
introduced below are available through ANTsX (specifically, via R and Python
ANTsX packages), and illustrated through self-contained examples in the ANTsX
tutorial (\url{https://tinyurl.com/antsxtutorial}) with a dedicated GitHub 
repository specific to this work
(\url{https://github.com/ntustison/ANTsXMouseBrainMapping}).

### The DevCCF velocity flow model

Recently, the Developmental Common Coordinate Framework (DevCCF) was introduced
to the mouse brain research community as a public resource [@Kronman:2023aa]
comprising symmetric atlases of multimodal image data and anatomical
segmentations defined by developmental ontology.  These templates sample the
mouse embryonic days (E) 11.5, E13.5, E15.5, E18.5 and postnatal day (P) 4, P14,
and P56.  Modalities include light sheet flourescence miscroscopy (LSFM) and at
least four MRI contrasts per developmental stage.  Anatomical parcellations are
also available for each time point and were generated from ANTsX-based mappings
of gene expression and other cell type data.  Additionally, the P56 template was
integrated with the Allen CCFv3 to further increase the practical utility of the
DevCCF. These processes, specifically template generation and multi-modal image
mapping, were performed using ANTsX functionality in the presence of 
image mapping difficulties such as missing slices, tissue distortion.  

Given the temporal gaps in the discrete set of developmental atlases, we also
provide an open-source framework, through ANTsX, for inferring correspondence
within the temporally continuous domain sampled by the existing set of embryonic
and postnatal atlases of the DevCCF.  This recently developed ANTsX
functionality permits the generation of a diffeomorphic velocity flow
transformation model [@Beg:2005aa], influenced by previous work
[@Tustison:2013ac].  The resulting time-parameterized velocity field spans the
stages of the DevCCF where mappings between any two continuous time points
within the span bounded by the E11.5 and P56 atlases is determined by
integration of the optimized velocity field. 

### Structural morphology and cortical thickness in the mouse brain

One of the most frequently utilized pipelines in the ANTsX toolkit is that of
determining cortical thickness in the human brain originating with the the
Diffeomorphic Registration-based Cortical Thickness (DiReCT) algorithm
[@Das:2009uv].  This development was later expanded to constitute a complete
cortical thickness pipeline for the human brai≈Ü for both cross-sectional
[@Tustison:2014ab] and longitudinal [@Tustison:2019aa] using T1-weighted MR
image data.  These pipelines were later significantly refactored using deep 
learning innovations [@Tustison:2021aa].

In contrast to the pipeline development in human data [@Tustison:2021aa], no
current ANTsX tools exist to create adequate training data for the mouse brain.
In addition, mouse brain data acquisition often has unique issues, such as lower
data quality or sampling anisotropy which limits its applicability to high
resolution resources (e.g., AllenCCFv3, DevCCF), specifically with respect to
the corresponding granular brain parcellations derived from numerous hours of
expert annotation leveraging multimodal imaging resources.

Herein, we introduce a mouse brain cortical thickness pipeline comprising two
novel deep learning components:  two-shot learning brain extraction from data
augmentation of two ANTsX templates generated from two open datasets
[@Hsu2021;@Reshetnikov2021] and single-shot brian parcellation derived from the
AllenCCFv3 labelings mapped to the corresponding DevCCF P56 time point.  Although we
anticipate that this cortical thickness pipeline will be beneficial to the
research community, this work demonstrates more generally how one can leverage
ANTsX tools for developing tailored brain parcellation schemes.  Evaluation is
performed on an independent open data set [@Rahman:2023aa] comprising
longitudinal acquisitions of multiple specimens.
