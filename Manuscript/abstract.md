Precision mapping techniques coupled with high resolution image acquisition of
the mouse brain permit the study of the spatial organization of gene activity
and their mutual interaction for a comprehensive view of salient
structural/functional relationships. Such research is facilitated by
standardized anatomical coordinate systems, such as the well-known Allen Common
Coordinate Framework (AllenCCFv3), and the ability to spatially map to such standardized
spaces.  The Advanced Normalization Tools Ecosystem is a comprehensive
open-source software toolkit for generalized quantitative imaging with
applicability to multiple organ systems, modalities, and animal species. Herein,
we illustrate the utility of ANTsX for generating precision spatial mappings of
the mouse brain and potential subsequent quantitation.  We describe ANTsX-based
workflows for mapping domain-specific image data to AllenCCFv3 accounting for
common artefacts and other confounds.  Novel contributions include ANTsX
functionality for velocity flow-based mapping spanning the spatiotemporal domain
of a longitudinal trajectory which we apply to the Developmental Common
Coordinate Framework.  Additionally, we present an automated structural
morphological pipeline for determining volumetric and cortical thickness
measurements analogous to the well-utilized ANTsX pipeline for human
neuroanatomical structural morphology which illustrates a general open-source
framework for tailored brain parcellations.
