Precision mapping techniques coupled with high resolution image acquisition of
the mouse brain permit the study of the spatial organization of gene activity
and their mutual interaction for a comprehensive view of salient
structural/functional relationships. Such research is facilitated by
standardized anatomical coordinate systems, such as the well-known Allen Common
Coordinate Framework , and the ability to spatially map to such standardized
spaces.   The Advanced Normalization Tools Ecosystem (ANTsX) is a comprehensive
open-source software image analysis toolkit, which includes template building and
mapping functionality, with applicability to multiple organ systems, modalities,
and animal species. Herein, we illustrate the utility of ANTsX for generating
precision spatial mappings of the mouse brain using the recently proposed
Developmental Common Coordinate Framework.  These longitudinal, discretely
sampled atlases are used to generate a velocity flow-based mapping spanning
the spatiotemporal domain of the developmental trajectory with future work 
accommodating the introduction of additional developmental time points.
