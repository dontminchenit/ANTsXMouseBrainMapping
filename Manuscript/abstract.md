Precision mapping techniques coupled with high resolution image acquisition of
the mouse brain permit the study of the spatial organization of gene activity
and their mutual interaction for a comprehensive view of salient
structural/functional relationships. Such research is facilitated by
standardized anatomical coordinate systems, such as the well-known Allen Common
Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3), and the ability to map to such reference
atlases.   The Advanced Normalization Tools Ecosystem (ANTsX) is a comprehensive
open-source software image analysis toolkit with applicability to multiple organ
systems, modalities, and animal species.  Herein, we illustrate the utility of
ANTsX for generating precision spatial mappings of the mouse brain of different
developmental ages including the prerequisite preprocessing steps. Additionally,
as a further illustration of ANTsX capabilities, we use these publicly available 
mouse brain atlases to generate a velocity flow-based mapping encompassing the 
entire developmental trajectory, which we also make available to the public.
