Precision mapping techniques coupled with high resolution image acquisition of
the mouse brain permit the study of the spatial organization of gene activity
and their mutual interaction for a comprehensive view of salient
structural/functional relationships. Such research is facilitated by
standardized anatomical coordinate systems, such as the well-known Allen Common
Coordinate Framework (AllenCCFv3), and the ability to spatially map to such
standardized spaces.   The Advanced Normalization Tools Ecosystem (ANTsX) is a
comprehensive open-source software toolkit for generalized quantitative imaging,
which includes template building and mapping functionality, with applicability
to multiple organ systems, modalities, and animal species. Herein, we illustrate
the utility of ANTsX for generating precision spatial mappings of the mouse
brain.  First, we provide ANTsX-based protocols for mapping MERFISH, fMOST, and
lightsheet datasets to AllenCCFv3 accounting for common artefacts and other
confounds.  Additionally, recently developed ANTsX functionality permits the
generation of velocity flow-based mappings for serial data. Using the recently
introduced Developmental Common Coordinate Framework, we evaluate and describe
the publicly available ANTsX-based protocols for generating a velocity
flow-based mapping spanning the spatiotemporal domain of the developmental
trajectory.   Possible future work includes the introduction of additional
developmental time points and application to histological slice stacking.
